# Low-level API

The starting point of this crate is the idea that data must be stored in memory in a specific arrangement to be interoperable with Arrow's ecosystem. With this in mind, this crate does not use `Vec` but instead has its own containers to store data, including sharing and consuming it via FFI.

The most important design decision of this crate is that contiguous regions are shared via an `Arc`. In this context, the operation of slicing a memory region is `O(1)` because it corresponds to changing an offset and length. The tradeoff is that once under an `Arc`, memory regions are immutable.

The second important aspect is that Arrow has two main types of data buffers: bitmaps, whose offsets are measured in bits, and byte types (such as `i32`), whose offsets are measured in bytes. With this in mind, this crate has 2 main types of containers of contiguous memory regions:

* `Buffer<T>`: handle contiguous memory regions of type T whose offsets are measured in items
* `Bitmap`: handle contiguous memory regions of bits whose offsets are measured in bits

These hold _all_ data-related memory in this crate.

Due to their intrinsic immutability, each container has a corresponding mutable (and non-shareable) variant:

* `MutableBuffer<T>`
* `MutableBitmap`

Let's see how these structures are used.

Create a new `Buffer<u32>`:

```rust
# use arrow2::buffer::Buffer;
# fn main() {
let x = Buffer::from(&[1u32, 2, 3]);
assert_eq!(x.as_slice(), &[1u32, 2, 3]);

let x = x.slice(1, 2);
assert_eq!(x.as_slice(), &[2, 3]);
# }
```

Using a `MutableBuffer<f64>`:

```rust
# use arrow2::buffer::{Buffer, MutableBuffer};
# fn main() {
let mut x = MutableBuffer::with_capacity(4);
(0..3).for_each(|i| {
    x.push(i as f64)
});
let x: Buffer<f64> = x.into();
assert_eq!(x.as_slice(), &[0.0, 1.0, 2.0]);
# }
```

In this context, `MutableBuffer` is the closest API to rust's `Vec`.

The following demonstrates how to efficiently
perform an operation from an iterator of [TrustedLen](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.TrustedLen.html):

```rust
# use std::iter::FromIterator;
# use arrow2::buffer::{Buffer, MutableBuffer};
# fn main() {
let x = Buffer::from_iter((0..1000));
let iter = x.as_slice().iter().map(|x| x * 2);
let y = unsafe { Buffer::from_trusted_len_iter(iter) };
assert_eq!(y.as_slice()[50], 100);
# }
```

Using `from_trusted_len_iter` often causes the compiler to auto-vectorize.

We will now see how these containers are used in higher-level structures: Arrays.
