Creating this function requires time, but using it is faster than [filter] when the same filter needs to be applied to multiple arrays (e.g. a multiple columns)."],["filter","Filters an [Array], returning elements matching the filter (i.e. where the values are true)."],["filter_chunk","Returns a new [Chunk] with arrays containing only values matching the filter. This is a convenience function: filter multiple columns is embarassingly parallel."]],"type":[["Filter","Function that can filter arbitrary arrays"]]};
